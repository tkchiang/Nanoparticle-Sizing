# Nanoparticle Sizing

This repository contains MATLAB and Python code that analyzes light scattering data.

These data are from dynamic light scattering (DLS) and differential dynamic microscopy (DDM) experiments, which are techniques used for measuring the size distributions of nanoparticles diffusing in an aqueous solution.
